		My name is Erik Ihrén. Since an early age I've been into all kinds of technology, writing text-based adventure games and assembling computers in my early teens. I quickly got into the industry and interned at companies like <b>Netnod</b> and <b>Ericsson</b>. I also travelled to South Africa to work at <b>Domain Name Services</b> for two months in the summer of 2013. I enjoy participating in programming events and competition and have several top placements from competitions such as Spotify's Hockey Challenge.
		<br><br>
		In my free time, I've worked on developing a multiplayer strategy game mod for Starcraft 2, called <b>Cruiser Command</b>. It's played by players around the world with an average rating of over 4.7/5 out of thousands of reviews. Personal projects are important to me, and I enjoy spending time working and experimenting with ideas I have.
		<br><br>
		I am currently working towards a Master's degree in Computer Science at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden. I am in my third year out of five and I'm actively looking for internships and other opportunities to improve as a programmer. I'm willing to relocate, especially for internships in America.
		<br><br>
		This site contains a portfolio with descriptions of some of the larger projects I've done as well as some general contact information.

		<p>Cruiser Command</p>
		Cruiser Command is a multiplayer strategy game created as a custom mod for Starcraft 2. It's a highly tactical game requiring a lot of teamwork to come out victorious over the other team.
		<br><br>      
		I started working on it in 2011 using Starcraft 2's Galaxy Editor. Since then I have kept developing and maintaining it while communicating with the active playerbase about their thoughts and ideas. 
		<br><br>
		Since it went public it has been played by thousands of players and maintained an average rating of over <b>4.7/5</b> from over 2000 reviews. The game has a loyal fanbase with some players having played the game for thousands of hours. There's also an active <a href="http://www.cruisercommand.com">forum</a> with 120 registered users.

		<p>SuperWebRecorder</p>
		During the spring of 2014 I spent several months working with 8 other KTH students on a project for the company The Beta Family. The Beta Family works with offering crowdsourced beta testing for companies by connecting a community of beta testers with a community of devlopers. To simplify this, we were tasked to create an application that records users' website experiences. This meant recording everything that happened on the site, following the user's path throughout the different pages of the site and recording the interactions. The recordings were then saved in a database to be replayed later on by the developer. It also included aggregation functions to combine replay data for visualizations such as heatmaps.
<br><br>
I was the project manager, but I also spent an active part on the programming group. It was a great experience and my first taste of programming in a slightly larger team. In the end, The Beta Family were very happy with the results and so were we.
